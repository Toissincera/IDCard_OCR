# IDCard_OCR
You have an IDCard based gate. You need each's info as text, on scan.

Okay so I know I have started wayyy too many projects, but unfinished projects should not preclude my pursuit for better projects' progression.
Anyway, here's wonderwall.

First, we set up an OCR for India's national ID system, the Adhaar Card. 
Scan it, and the machine will, hopefully, scrap all data as text and assign it to each feature.

Then we move to passports, because getting a sample passport database is harder than stealing the Kohinoor, jeesus cristo!!
With a working machine, I can move from Adhaar, a static card, to passport, with unique format/syntax/language et al.
I am so gonna mess this up, I am terrified.
